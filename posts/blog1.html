Hmm, where should I start?
I was at the shopping mall (Pothys), and I was getting some items for myself.
Usually, I just take them and leave, not bothering about what others are taking, but that day,
as I was about to take a block of paneer, I saw a woman next to me smile and take paneer from another brand.
Like, why?
Because of the brand? But I haven’t heard that brand name.
Because of the price? But I took the moderate one, like the tofu, because it has more protein than paneer.
I deduced from her outer appearance that she was from an above-middle-class family,
based on what she was wearing. I peeked at her phone, and it was like a Vivo Y30 to Y50 series, and her pouch wasn’t in trend.
Hence, she’s still coping with modernity.
Then, why did she take the cheapest one?
So, I decided to go on an adventure to understand why people choose a specific item from a specific brand and not another.
