            <h1><u><strong>THIS NOT THAT</strong></u></h1>
            <p> [ <strong>Published:</strong> January 18, 2025 ] </p>
            <p>Hmm where should is start?
            </br>
            i was at the shoping mall [ pothys ] and i was geting some items for mylself. 
        </br>
        usually i just take em and leave dont bother about what others are taking but that day </br> as i was about to take a block of paneer i saw a women next to me smiled and took paneer of another brand.
    </br>
    like why?
</br>
Coz of the brand ? but i havnt heard that brand name.
</br>
Coz of price ? but i took like the moderate one like the tofu coz it has more protien than paneer.
</br>
i deduced her from the outer personality and noticed that she was from above middle class family,
</br>
coz what she was wearing and i peaked at her phone and it was like vivo y30 to 50 series and and her pouch was not of trend,
</br>
hence she is still coping with the modernity.
</br>
then why did she took that cheapest one ?
</br>
So i decided to go on an adventure to know why people take a specific item of a specific brand not the other.
